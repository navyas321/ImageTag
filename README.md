# ImageTag
Takes all the images in a directory and assigns them tags, after uploading the images to an external server, so the images can be searched using those tags. Uses Clarify API.

• Collects all the images on the device

• Images are then scanned

• Characteristics of the corresponding images are identified

• Several tags describing the image are automatically generated

• Tags are stored in the device respective to its assigned image

• Corresponding image is displayed when searched by those tags

• Images only need to be tagged and indexed once

• Thus saving valuable time by not needing to search the entire gallery
